      Here's a bunch of English text that won't show up, so that hopefully stupid fucking Chrome will stop thinking this fucking page is in Southern Sotho and offering to translate.
      Gosh golly fucking jeepers would it ever be nice if I could just fucking TELL Chrome that the page is in English, but nope, there's no fucking way to do that.
      You can tell it to not offer to translate at all, but you can't tell it "Yo, if'n you wanna translate this, FYI, you're starting from [whatever]."
      On principle, I don't like telling it to never translate, so I guess the only alternative is to give it enough fucking English text that it can piece together that the fucking page is in fucking English.
      In case it wasn't clear: fuck you, Chrome, your browser is fucking dogshit.  This is a pretty obvious problem with a pretty obvious solution.
      Just look!  Up above!  At the opening html tag!  I fucking told you what language this is!  Twice!
      And look, in that meta tag in the head!  I told you a third fucking time!  Pull your fucking heads out of your fucking asses!
      If that's not enough text yet, I'll be back soon to berate you further, you fucking dunces.
